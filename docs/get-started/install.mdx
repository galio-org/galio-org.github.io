## How to install

Just add it as an npm/yarn dependency:

```bash
npm install galio-framework or yarn add galio-framework
```

And just import the component you want in your application:

```jsx
import { Text } from 'galio-framework'
```

This seems really easy right? Just use your component like you would normally do with any other component.

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text p muted>Hi, I'm a Galio component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
