# Integrating Algolia Search with Galio Documentation

This tutorial will guide you through setting up Algolia DocSearch for your Docusaurus-powered Galio documentation.

Algolia DocSearch provides a powerful and customizable search experience for your documentation website.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1.  An Algolia account. You can sign up for a free DocSearch account if your project is open-source and publicly available.
2.  Your Algolia Application ID, Search API Key, and Index Name (provided by Algolia after setting up DocSearch).

## Step 1: Configure Docusaurus

Open your `docusaurus.config.ts` file and locate the `themeConfig` section. You should already have an `algolia` object. Ensure it's configured correctly with your Algolia credentials.

```typescript:/docusaurus.config.ts
themeConfig: {
  algolia: {
    appId: 'YOUR_ALGOLIA_APP_ID',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY',
    indexName: 'YOUR_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME',
    contextualSearch: true,
    // Optional: Specify search parameters
    searchParameters: {},
    // Optional: path for search page that Algolia will use to direct users to a search results page
    searchPagePath: 'search',
    // Optional: disable insights tracking
    insights: false,
  },
  // ... other themeConfig options
},
```

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_ALGOLIA_APP_ID`, `YOUR_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY`, and `YOUR_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME` with your actual Algolia credentials.

## Step 2: Indexing Your Content

Algolia DocSearch requires a crawler to index your documentation content. If you applied for DocSearch, Algolia will provide you with a configuration file for their crawler. You typically don't run this crawler yourself; Algolia handles it on their end based on your provided configuration.

If you are self-hosting the crawler or using a different Algolia index, you would need to set up and run the Algolia DocSearch crawler. Refer to the [Algolia DocSearch documentation](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/indexing/) for detailed instructions on configuring and running the crawler.

## Step 3: Deploy Your Documentation

After configuring `docusaurus.config.ts` and ensuring your content is indexed by Algolia, deploy your Docusaurus site. The search bar should now appear and function correctly.

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve # To test locally
# Or deploy to your hosting service
```

## Troubleshooting

*   **Search bar not appearing:** Double-check your `docusaurus.config.ts` for typos in the `algolia` configuration.
*   **Search results are empty or incorrect:** Ensure your Algolia crawler is running and successfully indexing your content. Check your Algolia dashboard for crawler logs and index status.
*   **API Key security:** The `apiKey` used in `docusaurus.config.ts` is your *Search API Key*, which is safe to expose publicly. Do NOT use your *Admin API Key* in client-side code.

By following these steps, you should have Algolia search successfully integrated into your Galio documentation!
